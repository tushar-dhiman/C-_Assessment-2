/*
When you post a message on Facebook, depending on the number of people who like your post, Facebook displays different information.

· If no one likes your post, it doesn't display anything.

· If only one person likes your post, it displays: [Friend's Name] likes your post.

· If two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1] and [Friend 2] like your post.

· If more than two people like your post, it displays: [Friend 1], [Friend 2] and [Number of Other People] others like your post.

Write a program and continuously ask the user to enter different names, until the user presses Enter (without supplying a name). 
Depending on the number of names provided, display a message based on the above pattern.
